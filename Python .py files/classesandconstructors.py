# Create another user called user_2!

# Print user_ada's last name.
# Print user_2's last name. (Yes, they should be the same)

# Run the code, pause, go back and step through one line at a time
# What do you notice about the order it runs in?
# Write down any other questions you have.

# Sensei Exercise: try just printing the variable, user_ada.
#   What prints to the terminal?
